To-Do:

```python
  def hello(human):
    print("Hello "+human)
    return
```

Having made the move from Pelican to Jeykll and hosting from AWS to Github pages there are a few things that I will need to investigate.

1. Would it be worth moving to Gitlab to gain support for mermaid diagrams?
2. Photo gallery functionality. - Yes! See https://opieters.github.io/jekyll-image-gallery-example/photography/
4. Link pages to one or more tags.
5. Ensure theme CSS for codeblocks is good in dark mode.
6. Thumbnail image for posts.
7. Any useful integration with jupyiter notebook to demo code.

Things I intend to post:

1. Physics revision notes for Electromagnetism
2. Maths notes for ODE's, PDE's, Fourier and Vector Calculus.
4. Stats notes for Discrete and Cont. distributions; regressions and hyp testing.
5. Transfer my travel posts from Pelican.
6. Gifs; memes; things that amuse me.
7. Code for building automation frameworks {Selenium;Maven;Cucumber etc}
