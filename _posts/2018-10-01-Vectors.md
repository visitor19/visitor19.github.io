Numbers are great. 5 is is a fantastic example of a number, as is 7. 1024 is a handy number too. Numbers provide us with information about the magnitude of a quantity of interest. It is often very useful though to talk about magnitude in a particular direction. We gain extra information by stating 7 Mph North, or 5 metres at a 45 degree angle. In mathematical language we call quantities which only describe magnitude as scalars and quantities which convey magnitude and direction, vectors.

Vectors allow us to represent a magnitude with an associated direction. We might think of a vector as a displacement from one point in space to another or as a position in space with respect to a point of origin.

Algebraically we denote a a vector using bold text e.g. $$\bf{a}$$, underlining $$\underline{a}$$ or $$\vec{a}$$ to distinguish it from a scalar $$a$$. Hence; the vector $$\vec{a} = 3$$ Metres North is the vector labelled 'a' which has a magnitude of $$3$$ 'Metres' and a direction of 'North'. The scalar $$a=3$$ Metres tells us magnitude of the displacement from the orgin but no direction in which to orient ourselves.
