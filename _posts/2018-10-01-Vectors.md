Numbers are great. 5 is is a fantastic example of a number, as is 7. 1024 is a handy number too. Numbers provide us with information about the magnitude of a quantity of interest. It is often very useful though to talk about magnitude in a particular direction. We gain extra information by stating 7 Mph North, or 5 metres at a 45 degree angle. In mathematical language we call quantities which only describe magnitude as scalars and quantities which convey magnitude and direction, vectors.


Vectors allow us to represent a magnitude with an associated direction.
