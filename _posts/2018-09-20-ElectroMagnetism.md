>Basic overview of electromagnetism:

The matter in our Universe is found to be composed of what we call elementary particles. Some of these particles have a property known as charge. It is charge that is responsible for the electromagnetic force. Electromagnetism is one of the four known forces, the others being Gravity; Strong Nuclear Force and Weak Nuclear Force.

Whereas Gravity is an attractive force; Electromagnetism can be both repulsive or attractive as the charge property has two types. Like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract.

Charges can be stationary or in motion. The study of stationary charges is known as Electrostatics; the study of charges in motion, Electrodynamics.

Quarks comprise Atoms comprise Molecules comprise matter. At the Atomic level an Atom contains a nucleus which consists of neutrons (no charge) and protons (positive charged). Orbiting the nucleus are electrons (negatively charged).

Electrons orbit their atoms at discrete distances from the nucleus. These are known as shells. There are a discrete number of electrons that can orbit in a given shell. The number of electrons, protons and neutrons an atom has determines which type of material 'element' the atom is.

An atom holds on to it's electrons; but in some materials the final shell (known as the valance shell) of the atom contains loosely bound electrons which can flow to other atoms.

Atoms which can pass free electrons are known as conductors. Most metals are conductors. Atoms which cannot pass free electrons are known as insulators. Glass and Rubber are examples of insulators.

The flow of electrons (Negative Charge) is called Current. 1 Amp is equal to 1 Coulomb and 1 Coulomb is equal to 6,242,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second. As electrons flow away from negative charges and towards positive charges; current flows from negative to positive.  

Voltage is a pushing force of electrons. In a conductor without an applied voltage the free electrons will pass from atom to atom in a random manner and in no particular direction.

An applied voltage will force the free electrons to move in the same direction. Flowing from negative to positive, or from high potential to low potential.  

The higher the voltage the more electrons can flow. 1 Volt = 1 Joule per Coulomb. A joule being a unit of energy and a Coulomb being a unit of charge (i.e number of electrons).
