The problem: Given a particle with a known net charge. Is it possible to calculate how other electric charges will interact with it when they are nearby? From Faraday every charged particle generates an electric field that permeates all of space and exerts a force on all charged particles it encounters. The electric field carries energy which it imparts on other charged particles by exerting electric forces.

Charge is the source of electric field $$\vec{E}$$. The space around a charge Q is thought of as being subtly modified by the presence of the charge. It is said that the charge Q produces an electric field in it's surroundings. The electric field does not require the presence of a medium. A second charge q placed somewhere in the region of Q responds locally to the electric field produced by Q.

A field is a physical quantity which, at each instant, has definite values throughout a region of space. The values at each instant of the electric field are vectors and hence it is referred to as a vector field. To define the value of the electric field at a given point $$\vec{r}$$, a test charge is placed at the point and the electric force exerted on it is measured. The electric field is measured in electric force per unit charge.

$$\vec{E_r} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}$$

The magnitude E of the electric field is called the electric field strength.

$$E = |\vec{E}| = \sqrt{E_x^2+E_y^2+E_z^2}$$

Given the electric field at a given point $$\vec{r}$$, the force acting on any charge q placed at $$\vec{r}$$ is given by $$\vec{F}=q\vec{E}(\vec{r})$$

>Note: The field is defined at any point $$\vec{r}$$ that is not coincident with one of the source charges; at the source charge themselves, it is undefined.
