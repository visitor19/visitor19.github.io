The problem: Given a particle with a known net charge. Is it possible to calculate how other electric charges will interact with it when they are nearby? From Faraday every charged particle generates an electric field that permeates all of space and exerts a force on all charged particles it encounters. The electric field carries energy which it imparts on other charged particles by exerting electric forces.
